## Overview

The Softshark website was developed as a modern, responsive company page to present services, team, and company culture. I led the frontend development using Next.js and React.js, implementing a performant and SEO-optimized architecture designed for scalability and ease of maintenance.

Based on Figma designs, I created fully responsive sections from scratch, ensuring visual accuracy and consistent user experience across all devices. The project involved close collaboration with designers and stakeholders to ensure a pixel-perfect implementation of the layout and branding guidelines.

I leveraged Next.js for its powerful features such as routing, image optimization, and built-in SSR/SSG support to improve performance and page load speed. The result is a sleek and professional website that effectively communicates the company’s identity.
## Key Features

- **Component Library**: Built a set of modular, reusable UI components using React and styled-components in Next.js, focusing on accessibility and responsiveness.
- **Pixel-Perfect UI Development**: Translated detailed Figma designs into responsive, mobile-friendly layouts using React.js and CSS modules.
- **SEO Optimization**: Utilized Next.js Static Generation (SSG) and meta-tag best practices to ensure the site ranks well on search engines.
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Ensured consistent rendering and responsiveness across all major browsers and devices.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js/React.js**: For fast, server-rendered React applications.
- **Figma**: For creating and managing design assets and prototypes.
- **Styled-Components**: For styling React components with a modular, themable approach.
- **JavaScript, HTML, CSS Modules / Sass**

## Challenges and Learnings

One key challenge was translating complex design elements into a fully responsive layout while maintaining pixel-perfect accuracy. I refined my workflow for working closely with designers and improved my skills in layout techniques, component organization, and SSR/SSG in Next.js.
## Outcome

The new Softshark website delivers a professional and engaging digital presence. It's optimized for performance, easily maintainable, and flexible enough to support future content or feature updates. It now serves as a reliable point of contact for clients, partners, and potential hires.
