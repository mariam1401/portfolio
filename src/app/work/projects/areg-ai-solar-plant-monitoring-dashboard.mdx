## Overview

AregAI is a web-based dashboard developed to monitor solar power plants in real time. As the sole frontend developer, I built the application from scratch using ReactJS and TypeScript, designing a scalable and maintainable architecture tailored for performance and usability.

The interface was crafted with Material UI and enhanced using custom Sass styling, ensuring a clean, responsive, and user-friendly experience. Real-time data from multiple plants is fetched via backend APIs and visualized using interactive D3.js charts, allowing users to monitor energy output, detect anomalies, and analyze system performance.

State management was handled with Redux, enabling complex data flows and smooth interactions throughout the application. The project also included responsive layout optimizations for different screen sizes and performance tuning to handle high-volume data updates efficiently.
## Key Features

- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Integrated live data updates for energy production, system health, and anomaly detection across multiple solar plants.
- **Data Visualization**: Built dynamic and interactive charts using D3.js to present performance metrics in an intuitive way.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed and implemented a maintainable code structure using ReactJS, TypeScript, and Redux for state management.
- **Responsive UI**: Developed a mobile-friendly, modern interface using Material UI components and custom Sass styling.
## Technologies Used

- **ReactJS, TypeScript, JavaScript**: For fast, server-rendered React applications.
- **Figma**: For creating and managing design assets and prototypes.
- **Material UI, Sass, HTML/CSS**: For styling React components with a modular, themable approach.
- **D3.js**: For advanced data visualizations.

## Challenges and Learnings

A key challenge was efficiently rendering large volumes of real-time data while keeping the UI responsive. Leveraging D3.js and optimizing rendering logic helped maintain performance. I also gained deeper experience in managing complex state using Redux, and designing scalable component architecture in React with TypeScript for long-term maintainability.

## Outcome

The AregAI dashboard is now actively used for real-time monitoring across various solar power plants, providing engineers and operators with clear insights into system performance. The result is a faster, more reliable way to detect and act on anomalies—improving plant efficiency and minimizing downtime.
