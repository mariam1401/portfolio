## Overview

This project involved building a plugin store platform, similar to the WordPress plugin ecosystem, where users can browse, install, and manage various plugins with ease. I led the frontend development using Next.js, React.js, and TypeScript, focusing on delivering a fast, responsive, and user-friendly interface that supports smooth interactions and scalability.

The platform was integrated with a backend system to fetch plugin data, handle user actions, and manage installations. Special attention was given to UX design, responsiveness, and SEO best practices to ensure an optimal experience on both desktop and mobile devices.


## Key Features

- **Plugin Management Interface**: Developed clean, modular components for viewing plugin details, categories, and installation options using React.js and Next.js.
- **Theming and Customization**: Integrated a theming system that allows easy switching and customization of color palettes, typography, and layout styles using CSS variables and Figma tokens.
- **Figma Integration**: Collaborated closely with designers by setting up a shared design library in Figma. This library was synchronized with the codebase, ensuring design handoffs were seamless and that design tokens remained consistent across both platforms.
- **Documentation and Usage Guidelines**: Developed comprehensive documentation with Storybook to showcase components, usage patterns, and best practices, ensuring the design system is easy to adopt by other teams.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js / Recat.js**: For fast, server-rendered React applications.
- **Figma**: For creating and managing design assets and prototypes.
- **Styled-Components**: For styling React components with a modular, themable approach.
- **HTML, CSS**

## Challenges and Learnings

A key challenge was designing a flexible architecture that allows dynamic plugin rendering and installation logic, while ensuring performance and responsiveness. I deepened my expertise in Next.js SSG/SSR, API integration patterns, and frontend performance optimization.
## Outcome

The result was a modern, scalable plugin store that provides users with a seamless experience for discovering and managing plugins. It serves as a solid foundation for future feature expansions such as ratings, user accounts, and plugin version management.
