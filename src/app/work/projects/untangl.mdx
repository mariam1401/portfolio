## Overview

Untangl is a customer engagement and communication platform where I contributed as a frontend developer, focusing on building user-facing features and integrating real-time communication tools. I used React.js to create responsive, modular components and worked closely with backend and DevOps teams to integrate Amazon Connect, enabling cloud-based call center functionality within the application.

I implemented interfaces for call handling, agent status tracking, and customer communication history, ensuring seamless interaction between the frontend and Amazon Connect services. The project required deep collaboration with AWS SDKs and third-party APIs to provide a smooth and reliable user experience.


## Key Features

- **Figma Plugin Integration**: Developed a custom Figma plugin that extracts design tokens such as colors, typography, and spacing values, and exports them in a format compatible with our codebase.
- **Amazon Connect Integration**:  Integrated Amazon Connect into the frontend to support real-time voice communication, call controls, and agent-customer interaction tracking.
- **Continuous Sync**: Established a CI/CD pipeline that continuously synchronizes design changes from Figma to the codebase, ensuring design updates are reflected instantly without manual intervention.
- **Live Status Updates**: Implemented real-time updates to reflect agent availability and call states, enhancing responsiveness and transparency.

## Technologies Used

- **Figma API**: For extracting design tokens and component data directly from the Figma designs.
- **React.js, JavaScript**: For building the front-end codebase with clean, reusable components.
- **Amazon Connect, AWS SDK**
- **REST APIs, WebSockets**

## Challenges and Learnings

Integrating a cloud-based call center platform like Amazon Connect into a React application required careful handling of authentication, real-time events, and user feedback. I gained valuable experience working with AWS services, managing third-party integrations, and handling complex communication flows on the frontend.
## Outcome

The project delivered a fully functional and intuitive interface for customer communication, enabling agents to manage calls directly from the web platform. The integration with Amazon Connect significantly streamlined support operations, improving both efficiency and user satisfaction.
